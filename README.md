## Introduction:

This repository contains code & resources for thesis research project, titled **"Transiently Informed Robotic Swarms for Search & Rescue"**, being undertaken at the <a title="IISc" href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a>, Bengaluru.

**Thesis Advisors:** <a title="Professor Guttal" href="" target="_blank">Dr. Vishwesha Guttal</a> **[1]** & <a title="Professor Ghose" href="" target="_blank">Dr. Debasish Ghose</a> **[2]**.

- The main purpose of this package is to design a navigation stack for swarm robots, inspired by transient behaviour as seen in ant groups. <a title="Gelblum et al" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8729" target="_blank">**[3]**</a>

- We hypothesize, that such an architecture will bring about a reduction in the amount of energy expended by the entire swarm, all the while being directed along the right path to the destination.

**Note:** Currently, the repository contains basic movement <a title="Movement Code!" href="https://github.com/SarthakJShetty/Transient/blob/master/movement.py">scripts</a>. Other packages are lined up, and will ne integrated with ```rospy``` before being pushed here to the repository.
